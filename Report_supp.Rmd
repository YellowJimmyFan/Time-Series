# Scenario 1: Hydrological Forecast

## Analysis

I first plot the original series, and observe that:

* There is high variability in the first half of the series but 
then the variability becomes more moderate. 
This may indicate that the original time series is non-stationary. 

* The data also suggests a possible seasonal pattern, as it shows regular and 
frequent peaks and troughs.

*  The data covers 576 consecutive months, representing a 48-year period. 
Within each year, the value of data typically increase from January(assume 
the first value was recorded in January) to May, peaking at May, and then 
it decreases from May to December.

Then I apply seasonal differencing on the data to make it more stationary and 
take a log transformation to address the unstable variability. 
I think a 12th-order difference is appropriate in this case(yearly).

Next, I visually check acf/pacf of the differenced data and perform KPSS test 
on it. Visual inspection and KPSS result indicate that the differenced data is 
stationary, so I begin to fit a model.

```{r hydro analysis plots, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE}
data.hydro.diffed <- diff(log(data.hydro$Value), lag = 12)
acf(data.hydro.diffed, main = "", xlab = "")
pacf(data.hydro.diffed, main = "", xlab = "")
```

**Seasonal Component: **It appears that at the seasons, the PACF is cutting 
off at lag 1s(s = 12). The ACF is tailing off at at lag 1s, 2s. 
These results implies an SAR(1), SMA(1), P = 1, Q = 1, in the season(s = 12).

**Non-Seasonal Component: **Inspecting the sample ACF and PACF at the lower 
lags, it appears as though both are tailing off. This suggests an ARMA(1, 1) 
within the seasons, p = q = 1. Now since both the acf and pacf of differenced 
data tails off, and the time series shows a general seasonal pattern, I start 
with a SARIMA$(1,1,1) \times (1,1,1)_{12}$ model.

I generated several models, and these models are compared via AIC/BIC,
expanding window cross-validation error(see Appendix), and residual analysis.

I end up with a SARIMA$(3,1,1) \times (1,1,1)_{12}$ model with AIC=-4.223715, 
BIC=-4.169838, Expanding Window Cross-Validation MSE = 3.767112. I do not pick 
the other models because they either show higher AIC/BIC/CV_MSE or show more 
severe violations to model assumptions like white noise, normality. (Details 
can be found in my Supplementary file)

The figure below gives the diagnostic plots for my final model. The model seems 
to capture all the autocorrelation with only one lag outside the bands, so it 
is not a big concern. The residuals are randomly scattered around y=0, and 
there is one part of noticeable spike in the middle part which can be seen as 
outlier and it would not affect the model's overall performance. Moreover, the 
Box-Ljeung-Pierce test supports the assumption of white noise. 

One potential problem is that although the model is approximately normal, it 
has a slightly heavier tail which may negatively affect the performance of 
our prediction interval. It may be more likely to observe extreme values in 
this case, so the prediction interval may be adjusted wider to cover them.

# Scenario 2: Financial Risk Forecast
## Analysis

Since the series are all "financial", I focus on GARCH-type models in this 
scenario. I manually fit several models to each stock, compare them, and pick 
the most reasonable model among them. The same process is followed to 
analyze all the stock data, so I will just present one typical case. 

We are given the log differenced data, so stationarity is not a concern to me
(KPSS test and visual inspection are used to confirm stationarity). 
Instead, I mainly check:

* the squared time series to see if there are significant volatility clustering

* the acf of squared time series to confirm volatility clustering and 
identify lags that show significant autocorrelations

After detecting volatility clustering, I fit models and usually start with a 
GARCH(1, 1) model. I then check its validity by overlay its estimated 
conditional variance on the original series to see if the model can capture 
the structure/volatility in the series. The model's residuals are also checked 
to ensure it satisfies assumptions(a sequence of with mean 1, no pattern) of 
GARCH-type model. 

For most of the given data, GARCH(1, 1) would be way too under-specified. To 
address this, I typically:

* pick higher orders based on AIC/BIC/Expanding Window Cross-Validation MSE or

* use a more complex model such as "eGARCH"

For example, a GARCH(1, 1) model of stock4

```{r stock4 fit1, fig.height=3.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
stock4.fit1 <- garchFit(formula = ~ garch(1, 1), data = data.stock4, trace = FALSE)
stock4.fit1.sigma.sqr <- stock4.fit1@sigma.t^2
stock4.fit1.vol <- sqrt(stock4.fit1.sigma.sqr)
ts.plot(data.stock4, xlab="")
lines(stock4.fit1.vol, col = 'red')
```
It is clear the model does not capture the pattern in the data which may 
indicate the number of parameters included is not enough or model is too simple.

After adding number of parameters and using more complex models, compared by
information criterion AIC/BIC and cross-validation MSE, I end up with 
a eGARCH(4, 2) model with AIC=-4.389625, BIC=-4.148775, CV MSE= 0.0009684144. 
The mean of the residuals is $0.9613752 \approx 1$. (Model comparison and 
details can be found in my supplementary file)

The plots below gives the diagnostic plots of my final model for stock4. 
The model seems to capture all the autocorrelation with only one lag outside 
the bands, which is a good sign. The standardized residuals approximately 
follow a normal distribution. The conditional volatility laid on the original 
times series seem to do a good job at capturing the variablity in the data.

# Scenarios 3 and 4: Imputation and Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
## Analysis

The beer data covers 435 consecutive months, representing a roughly 36 year 
period, however the values between row 200 and row 230 are missing. There 
seems to be no observable seasonal pattern by purely visual inspection. 

Of all the extra data provided, I hypothesize temperature likely has a 
significant impact on the beer consumption based on common sense. This 
hypothesis is confirmed later by my model summary. The temperature data covers 
a broader range of dates than the beer data, which makes it 
easier to align their dates and values for use of multivariate time 
series models. I do not observe any direct relationship between beer 
consumption and other extra data like car data, electricity data. Therefore, 
I would not include these as exogenous variables to fit my model.

I initially split the beer data into two parts and analyze each part separately.

First part(corresponds to values from row1 to row200)

* There is a clear increasing trend and variability shown by its time 
series plot.

* There also appears to be some seasonality with repeating patterns at regular 
intervals(12 month by visual inspection). 

* The ACF show a slow decay, and significant autocorrelations 
occur at many lags.

Second part(corresponds to values from row231 to the last row)

* There is no observable trend and seasonality for the second part.

* The variability seems stable with minor fluctuations.

* The ACF shows a quick decay at lower lags, but it exhibits a recurring pattern.

Based on the findings I:

* take a log transformation overall to reduce the variability in the first part

* apply seasonal differencing with a lag of 12 to address non-stationarity

After these are done, I proceed to fit models. It is hard to pick seasonal or 
non-seasonal components orders by inspection since the data is split and 
contains missing values. Therefore, I conduct a grid-search over possible 
parameters and select a combination of orders that yields a reasonably 
low AIC/BIC. The optimal model I find is 
SARIMA$(10, 1, 0) \times (4, 1, 3)_{12}$ 
with temperature as an exogenous variable.

Then I pass this model to KalmanSmooth() to impute the missing values.

After imputing the missing values, I try different order combinations to see 
if there are better models. It turns out none improve my model, so I just 
stick with it for forecasting. Since there is no further temperature data 
available, I use its mean as the value for argument newexg.

The figure below gives the diagnostic plots for my final model. The model 
captures all the known autocorrelation with only two lags outside the bands, 
so it is generally good. The residuals are randomly scattered
around y=0 and the model looks approximately normal. Moreover, the 
Box-Ljeung-Pierce test supports the assumption of white noise although 
two points are below the confidence band(expected to see 5% of time).

                  seasonal = list(order=c(4, 1, 3), period = 12), xreg = exog)
```

# Scenarios 5: Long Horizon Pollution Forecasting
## Analysis

Initially, I plot the acf/pacf for each pollution series. I found that all the 
series follow some kind of ARMA process:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
acf(data.pollution1, main = "", xlab="")
pacf(data.pollution1, main = "", xlab="")
acf(data.pollution2, main = "", xlab="")
pacf(data.pollution2, main = "", xlab="")
acf(data.pollution3, main = "", xlab="")
pacf(data.pollution3, main = "", xlab="")
```

Therefore, I begin with some VARMA models. I have tried a few combination of 
orders, but they are not satisfying shown by model diagnostics.

Then I decide to fit models for each series instead of using multivariate 
methods. For each series:

* Auto.arima() is used to pick starting orders.

* Ordering picking are based on AIC/BIC and analysis on the residuals.

A log transformation is taken to stabilized the high variability for 
pollutionCity1 series.

PollutionCity2 and PollutionCity3 series both show minor volatility clustering 
by visual inspection, so I consider ARMA-GARCH models for them. However, the 
ARMA-GARCH models are not satisfying, and do not improve the pure ARMA model.
(Details can be found in supplementary files). 

I end up with one pure ARMA model for each pollution series.

* For pollution series1, the model is ARMA(4, 0, 3). The residuals from the 
model resemble white noise, tested using Ljungâˆ’Box statistic. The model is 
also approximately normal, confirmed by Normal Q-Q test. There is also no 
autocorrelation(pattern) remaining in the residuals.

* For pollution series2 and pollution series3, the final models are 
ARMA(10, 1, 5) and ARMA(8, 1, 3) respectively. Residuals from both models 
show no autocorrelations, and resemble white noise. Both of them have 
heavier tails, so the corresponding prediction intervals probably become wider 
to cover extreme values(heavier tails).
